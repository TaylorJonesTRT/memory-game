# Memory Game

[Live Demo](https://taylorjonestrt.github.io/memory-game/)

Memory Game is a challenge of memorization (name suites the project, doen't it). The objective is to keep going until you cant score any higher (right now the highest score possible is 36 or 37). If you click on a card that you haven't already you're score will go up, but if you click on one you have previously clicked on (in that current game) then it'll reset the game and update the best score if you surpassed it.



The Project was written using ReactJS using create-react-app to get it running. This project was created to help further understand how to make functional components within ReactJS and how to use hooks. This was my first project with React from start to finish that uses only functional components. During the creation of the project I stuck to a single responsibility for my functions as much as possible.



In the future I will come back to make this project mobile friendly as right now it works on anything bigger than a phone.
